# ⚔️ Champions Nexus – GenAI Character Analyzer for Gamers

**Champions Nexus** is a creative GenAI-powered tool that analyzes fictional characters and generates detailed profiles using structured prompt engineering. Whether you're a writer, game designer, or just a gamer with imagination — this app turns your prompt into a full-blown character analysis.

🛠️ Built in **React + TypeScript (Vite)** with Gemini API, this is a frontend-only project that blends AI engineering with clean, modern UI development.

## 🎮 Why I Built This

As a **regular MCOC (Marvel Contest of Champions) player**, I often found myself wondering:

> _“Is this character good? What are their strengths? Weaknesses? How should I use them in my team?”_

That curiosity led to an idea — why not build something that analyzes character prompts just like I think about game characters?

This project combines my:
- 🎮 Passion as a gamer
- 🧠 Curiosity about character design and strategy
- 💡 Learning from Google Cloud’s *Prompt Design in Vertex AI*
- 👨‍💻 Skills as a **Full Stack Developer**

Champions Nexus became the perfect fusion of all these worlds.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🔍 Accepts a character prompt (e.g., "A cyber ninja who controls shadows")
- 🧬 Uses Gemini (Gemma) API to generate:
  - Name
  - Powers
  - Appearance
  - Personality
  - Weaknesses
- 🧠 Applies prompt engineering techniques to guide output style
- ⚛️ Frontend-only — no backend needed
